# 🌐 Mini Social Network – Python Project

I have officially **started building my Mini Social Network project** as part of my **Python Learning** journey.  
This project is a **command-line social platform** where users can register, log in, create posts, and interact with profiles.

## 📅 Day 29 – Progress (05-Sep-2025)

### ✅ What I Did Today
- Set up **project structure** with modular files:
  - `Main.py` for menus and app flow  
  - `user.py` for registration, login, and profile management  
  - `Post.py` for post creation and storage  
  - `Util.py` for helper utilities and data loading  
- Added **core user system**:
  - Register with SHA-256 password hashing  
  - Login with secure verification  
- Implemented **profile system** with age, bio, and clean profile display  
- Added **basic post creation** with title, content, and timestamp  
- Used **JSON storage** (`users.json`, `posts.json`) for persistence  
- Added **schema validation** using `jsonschema`

## 🚧 What’s Remaining
- **Follow/Unfollow system** for users  
- **Feed display** showing posts from followed users  
- **Input validation & error handling improvements**  
- **Cleaner post viewing interface**  
- **Backup/Export feature** for user data
