 ðŸ“Œ Multi-Threading (basics)
        - Thread: The smallest unit of a program that can run independently.
        - Multithreading: Running multiple threads concurrently within the same program.
        - Useful for I/O-bound tasks (like file operations, network requests) rather than CPU-bound tasks (due to GIL in CPython).

    When we have to do some task parallely this is the best thing to do

Thread States (we will learn deeply later)
    - New â†’ Thread created but not started
    - Runnable â†’ Thread started, waiting for CPU
    - Running â†’ Thread currently executing
    - Waiting/Blocked â†’ Waiting for resource or sleep
    - Terminated â†’ Finished execution
