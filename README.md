# 🐍  Python Learning Journal
Hey there! Welcome to my Python learning adventure. I'm documenting my journey from Python newbie to hopefully something more than that. This repo is packed with examples, notes, and hands-on projects as I figure things out. Feel free to follow along, learn with me, or drop suggestions to help me grow as a Python programmer.

## 🎯 About
I started this Python learning journey on August 7th, 2025, with a goal: build solid Python knowledge and get really good at it. This repo is my learning playground, filled with code examples, personal notes, and small projects. My goal is to build strong Python fundamentals while sharing my progress and creating a resource for beginners like me.
Follow my progress and connect with me on Twitter @Dharmil_13 where I share updates and learning moments.
