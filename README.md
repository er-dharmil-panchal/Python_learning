# 🐍 Python Learning Journey – 60 Days of Code 🚀

> *“Consistency turns curiosity into mastery.”*

Hey there! I’m **Dharmil**, and this repository documents my **60-day journey of learning Python** — from printing my first `Hello World` to building full-fledged apps and dashboards.  
This repo includes notes, code snippets, daily logs, and mini-projects that shaped my foundation in Python, Data Analysis, and Streamlit.
