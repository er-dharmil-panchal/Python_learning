==========================================
üìå SUMMARY ‚Äì Python Threading Concepts
==========================================

1. Threading with Class
   - Create custom threads by subclassing `threading.Thread`.
   - Override `__init__` to pass data and `run()` to define logic.
   - Store results as object attributes since `run()` cannot return values.

2. Daemon Threads
   - Run in background, killed automatically when main program exits.
   - Normal (non-daemon) threads ‚Üí block main thread until finished.
   - Use `.daemon` property to check (instead of deprecated `.isDaemon()`).
   - Use daemon only for background tasks (logging, monitoring, autosave).

3. Locks & Synchronization
   - Race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data.
   - `Lock()` ensures only one thread modifies data at a time.
   - `with lock:` is safer than manual `acquire()`/`release()`.

4. RLock (Reentrant Lock)
   - Allows the same thread to acquire the lock multiple times.
   - Prevents deadlock when recursive locking is needed.

5. Semaphore
   - Controls how many threads can access a resource at the same time.
   - Example: `Semaphore(2)` ‚Üí max 2 threads inside critical section.

6. Condition
   - Used for signaling between threads.
   - Example: Producer/Consumer problem ‚Üí consumer waits until producer notifies.

7. Deadlocks
   - Occur if threads wait on each other forever (circular locking).
   - Fix by:
       - Locking resources in consistent order.
       - Using timeout in `lock.acquire(timeout=...)`.

‚úÖ Key Takeaways
   - Use class-based threads for complex jobs needing state.
   - Use daemon threads only for background, non-essential tasks.
   - Always use locks (or higher-level constructs) for shared data.
   - Avoid deadlocks by careful lock ordering or timeouts.
