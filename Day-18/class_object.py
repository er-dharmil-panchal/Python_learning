There are mainly 3 types of methods in a class
i. class methods
ii. instance methods
iii. static methods

NOTE:-
--> "Every instance method in Python must have self as its first parameter, 
    which represents the specific instance (object) that is calling the method."
--> "Every class method in Python must have cls as its first parameter, 
    which represents the class itself and allows access or modification of class-level variables and methods."
--> "A static method in Python does not take self or cls as the first parameter, 
    as it neither depends on the instance nor the class and behaves like a regular function inside the class."

    a1 = 5

"""
ðŸ“Œ Why Static Methods in Python?

Static methods are used when:
- The functionality is **logically related** to the class
- BUT it **does not need**:
    - Access to **class-level data** (`cls`)
    - Access to **instance-level data** (`self`)

Think of static methods like the "cleaner" in a company:
- The cleaner **belongs to the company** (logically part of it)
- But the cleaner **doesn't interact** with company policies, salaries, or management decisions
- The cleaner **just does their independent job** â€” like cleaning the office

# Example

class GoogleCompany:
    company_name = "Google"
    employees = []

    # NOTE: This is called the *constructor* in Python.
    # It runs automatically whenever you create a new object of the class.
    # We'll learn constructors in detail later â€” for now, just remember:
    # -> It sets up (initializes) data for each new object (instance).
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        GoogleCompany.employees.append(name)

    # Instance Method â†’ Works for specific employee
    def show_details(self):
        print(f"Employee: {self.name} | Company: {self.company_name}")

    # Class Method â†’ Works for the company itself
    @classmethod
    def change_company_name(cls, new_name):
        cls.company_name = new_name
        print(f"Company name changed to: {cls.company_name}")

    # Static Method â†’ Works independently (like a cleaner)
    @staticmethod
    def clean_office():
        print("ðŸ§¹ Office cleaned. Everything is fresh and tidy!")

# ------------------ USAGE ------------------

# Static method usage (no need for instance or class data)
GoogleCompany.clean_office()

# Adding employees (instance method)
emp1 = GoogleCompany("Alice")
emp2 = GoogleCompany("Bob")
emp1.show_details()
emp2.show_details()

# Changing company name (class method)
GoogleCompany.change_company_name("Alphabet Inc.")

# Cleaner still works independently
GoogleCompany.clean_office()


"""
ðŸ“Œ Constructor
    A constructor is a special method in a class that is used to **create and initialize an object**.
    It runs automatically whenever an object of the class is created.
    
    Key Points:
    - Used to set up basic information or properties of the object at creation time.
    - Helps avoid repetitive code for assigning values manually after creating the object.
    
    NOTE: The constructor is usually defined with `__init__`.
